Description: RCOMPSs is a programming model that simplifies the parallel execution of R code. It allows users to write applications as standard R scripts, simply marking certain functions as tasks. The underlying COMPSs runtime then automatically manages dependencies between tasks, creates a data dependency graph, and dynamically schedules tasks across distributed resources. This enables efficient and scalable execution with minimal modifications to the original R code, abstracting away the complexities of parallelization.
